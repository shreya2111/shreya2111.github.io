<h1> Extending Gentle Aligner </h1>
<h2> Week 1 Progress </h2>
<h4> Generating HCLG.fst and Acoustic model from Voxforge_ru (Russian ASR model) recipe </h4>

* Setting up Case HPC account, tried installing Kaldi on case cluster. Switched to AWS computing cluster ec2 to enable quick development.
* Installed Kaldi on AWS cluster, downloaded voxforge_ru recipe on the cluster and executed the recipe.
* Week 1 Task: Running [voxforge_ru recipe](https://github.com/grib0ed0v/kaldi-for-russian), generating ASR model. Figuring out how to extract timing information from the generated model.

* In order to install Kaldi, all dependencies must be satisfied. I faced an issue with MKL installation. It existed but it's path was not known to /.configure in 'src' directory of Kaldi files.

    * Use 'whereis MKL' to find the right path of the library Or look into bin/lib Or home/../intel/compilers_and../../mkl

* Another library 'srilm' required for running the russian recipe successfullly needed to be downloaded manually. 

* On running run.sh, feats.scp was not created and model was also not generated.
    
    ERROR: FstHeader::Read: Bad FST header: standard input

    In case, you are facing the same error, copy arpa2fst from src/lmbin to /usr/bin manually.
    [error thread](https://github.com/grib0ed0v/kaldi-for-russian/issues/1)

* These steps generated the model and the decoded graph in exp/mono or exp/tri 

* Next task is to figure out how to extract timing information from the graph stored in exp/tri i.e. final.mdl
