<h1> Extending Gentle Aligner </h1>
<h2> Week 12 </h2>
<h4> Summary </h4>

Overview:

* Trained Russian-ASR, built customized Russian langauge model and used it to produce time-alignments, visualizations.
* Built Singularity Container containing my work on time-alignment of Russian data
* Documented work through [blog-post](https://shreya2111.github.io/gsoc) & [git-repo](https://github.com/shreya2111/gentle-labs)
* Singularity-img for the project can be found at [gentle-singularity](https://github.com/shreya2111/gentle-singularity)

Goal:

* The idea was to make Gentle produce time-alignments in langauges other than English. 
* My work accomplishes generation of automated time-alignments in Russian, using Gentle's langauge model generation and decoding graph compilation codes. I have extensively used Kaldi's C libraries for generating the initial langauge files, decoding an audio input and producing conversation-to-time files (ctm). 
* Visualization: I also worked on a visualization that can clearly represent the time-alignment produced by generating json time-alignment data through my code. [link to viz](https://shreya2111.github.io/gsoc/gsocWk3)

What's Done?

* Building a sentence specific langauge model for Russian
* Automated Decoding using the customized langauge model
* Extension to customized German langauge model [Ongoing]
* Proper Documentation on github & jekyll blog

To Be Done Next!

* Getting automated time-alignments for German langauge using the customized langauge model
* Evaluating the results of customized langauge model and whole langauge model (trained on entire dataset)

> By customized langauge model I mean a langauge model built using just one utterance of that langauge which needs to be time-aligned with it's audio data.
