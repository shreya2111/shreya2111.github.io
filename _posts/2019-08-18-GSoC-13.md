<h1> Extending Gentle Aligner </h1>
<h2> Week 12 </h2>
<h3> Summary </h3>

#### This is last blogpost of my GSoC 2019 journey! 

Overview:
 
* Trained Russian automated speech recognition model, built customized Russian langauge model and used it to produce time alignments, visualizations.
* Built Singularity Container containing my work on time alignment of Russian data
* Documented work through [blogpost](https://shreya2111.github.io/gsoc) & [git repo](https://github.com/shreya2111/gentle-labs)
* Singularity image for the project can be found at [gentle-singularity](https://github.com/shreya2111/gentle-singularity)
* You can find the built singularity image on google drive [link to google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tt6xWZBODXElJm7aijcRDDTvglDYCHCF?usp=sharing)

* The idea was to make Gentle produce time alignments in langauges other than English. 
* My work accomplishes generation of automated time alignments in Russian, using Gentle's langauge model generation and decoding graph compilation code. I have extensively used Kaldi's C libraries for generating the initial langauge files, decoding an audio input and producing conversation-to-time files (ctm) [link to code](https://github.com/shreya2111/gentle-labs/tree/master/v2).
* Visualization: I also worked on a visualization that can clearly represent the time alignment produced by generating json time alignment data through my code [link to viz](https://shreya2111.github.io/gsocWk3).

What's Done?

* Building a sentence specific langauge model for Russian
* Automated Decoding using the customized langauge model
* Extension to customized German langauge model [Ongoing]
* Built Singularity images on AWS machine 
* Proper Documentation on github & jekyll blog

To Be Done Next!

* Getting automated time alignments for German langauge using the customized langauge model
* Evaluating the results of customized langauge model and whole langauge model (trained on entire dataset)

#### By customized langauge model I mean a langauge model built using just one utterance of that langauge which needs to be time aligned with it's audio data.
